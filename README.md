# Exohood Governance

The community manages Exohood through Governance, allowing any user to create proposals. Any user holder of EXO tokens can vote to pass or reject a proposal. 


Here is a quick outline of how the governance process works:


Submit a forum post (Proposal Discussion section).


Get in touch with Exohood Discord Admins to discuss your proposal in a community call as well as on Twitter Space.


Create another forum post in the Temperature Check section and publish a snapshot (temperature check) vote with a limit of 2-5 days. This action requires at least 500K EXO tokens delegated or self-delegated. For the snapshot to be valid, at least 25M EXO should participate. Please provide a TLDR process update on the top of your proposal to make it easily accessible.


Update the temperature check post with the community feedback.


Publish a snapshot (consensus check). This action requires at least 500K EXO tokens delegated or self-delegated. The snapshot will be deemed valid if there are at least 45M EXO.


Escalate the proposal to an on-chain vote. It is required to have at least 90M EXO delegated to do it. The vote gives smaller holders a chance to congregate and gather enough votes to push proposals on-chain.

Please read the **[Community rules](https://exohood.com/community-rules)**. This contains useful advice on how to be a productive community member.

Let´s try to keep posts in English as well. While we welcome discussion on Exohood in other languages (in, for example, the Exohood Discord), we don’t have the resources to handle multi-language support here.
